              print the byte counts

       -m, --chars
              print the character counts

       -l, --lines
              print the newline counts

       --files0-from=F
              read  input from the files specified by NUL-terminated names in
              file F; If F is - then read names from standard input

       -L, --max-line-length
              print the maximum display width

       -w, --words
              print the word counts

       Print selected parts of lines from each FILE to standard output.

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       Mandatory  arguments  to  long options are mandatory for short options
       too.

       -b, --bytes=LIST
              select only these bytes

       -c, --characters=LIST
              select only these characters

       -d, --delimiter=DELIM
              use DELIM instead of TAB for field delimiter

       -f, --fields=LIST
              select only these fields;  also print any line that contains no
              delimiter character, unless the -s option is specified

       -n     (ignored)

       --complement
              complement the set of selected bytes, characters or fields

       -s, --only-delimited
              do not print lines not containing delimiters

       --output-delimiter=STRING
              use  STRING  as  the output delimiter the default is to use the

       Use one, and only one of -b, -c or -f.  Each LIST is made  up  of  one
       range,  or many ranges separated by commas.  Selected input is written
       in the same order that it is read, and is written exactly once.   Each
       range is one of:

       N      N'th byte, character or field, counted from 1

       N-     from N'th byte, character or field, to end of line

       N-M    from N'th to M'th (included) byte, character or field

       -M     from first to M'th (included) byte, character or field
